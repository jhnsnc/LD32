NOTE! This is the actual source code for this game, but I wouldn't recommend copying any of it or borrowing any techniques from here. This game was built extremely quickly, and so I used lots of terrible, terrible shortcuts. For example, the game has obvious memory leaks and performance issues, but I left them in so I could get the game and all assets ready in 48 hours.
